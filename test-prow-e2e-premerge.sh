# Runs the mock-based, pre-merge Playwright suite (integration-tests/tests/*.premerge.spec.ts)
# against the OpenShift Console of a real (cluster_claim) test cluster.
#
# Unlike test-prow-e2e.sh (post-merge, which exercises the plugin against real cluster
# resources), the pre-merge suite intercepts K8s API responses via Playwright route
# mocking (see integration-tests/support/mock-api.ts) and does not require any
# secrets-management CRs/operators to actually be installed. It still needs a real,
# reachable console to serve the plugin UI, which the operator registers automatically
# on install (see ocp-secrets-management-operator CSV: "Register the plugin with OpenShift
# Console"). We therefore point Playwright's BRIDGE_BASE_ADDRESS at the claimed
# cluster's own console route, the same way test-prow-e2e.sh does for post-merge.
